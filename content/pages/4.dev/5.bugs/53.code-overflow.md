# Fix code overflow (issue #32)

## Code block

If there are no particular language, use `text` and no formatting applies.

```text
{
  "this is a very long key": "and this is a value with a large single line width which shall be fairly large as well"
}
```

## Inline code

Here we are creating `a-very-very-long-inline-code-to-be-embeded-inside-a-paragraph-and-which-is-larger-than-the-screen-width-to-make-sure-it-is-alright` without spaces.
