# Admin CLI usage

`tdp-lib` is an SDK that exposes objects that allow to plan, execute (via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) and monitor deployments based on a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

`tdp-lib` includes an **CLI** for administrators.

## Prerequisites

Having [installed TDP Manager](/en/learn/installation/tdp-manager) is required to use the admin CLI.

### Virtual environment activation

Activate the virtual environment created during the installation of TDP Manager:

```bash
# Virtual environment activation (optional)
source .venv/bin/activate
# Display help
tdp --help
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, the CLI can be used via the `tdp` command.

## First deployment

A deployment is done in two steps: planning and execution. The following commands allow you to deploy a TDP cluster by following the DAG in its entirety.

```bash
# Deployment planning
tdp plan dag
# Deployment execution
tdp deploy
```

## Updating a configuration

When changing a configuration, it is necessary to reconfigure all impacted services. For example, when changing the HDFS configuration, it is also necessary to reconfigure the HBase components that use HDFS as storage.

```bash
# Editing the datanodes' configuration
tdp vars edit hdfs datanode
# Deployment planning
tdp plan reconfigure
# Deployment execution
tdp deploy
```

## Other commands

Many other commands are available. For more information, consult the administration CLI documentation.

```bash
# Display help
tdp --help
```
