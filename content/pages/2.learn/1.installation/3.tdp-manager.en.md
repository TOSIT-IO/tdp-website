# TDP Manager Installation

TDP Manager is an orchestrator based on [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) allowing to deploy the TDP stack.

Note: Even if it brings many features, the use of TDP Manager is not mandatory. TDP can be [manually deployed](/en/learn/usage/manuel).

## Architecture

TDP Manager is composed as follows:

- `tdp-lib`, an SDK exposing objects that allow to plan, execute (via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) and monitor deployments based on a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). `tdp-lib` also includes an administration CLI allowing to manage the cluster.
- `tdp-server`, a web server providing a REST API on top of `tdp-lib`. It adds a user authentication layer.
- `tdp-ui`, a web interface that includes the functionalities of `tdp-server` and `tdp-lib`.

A relational database shared between `tdp-lib` and `tdp-server` is used to store metadata related to deployments.

`tdp-server` and `tdp-ui` can be connected to an OpenID Connect provider to authenticate users.

Note: Each module of TDP manager is designed to abstract the lower layers. For example, the administration CLI (`tdp-lib`) can be used alone, `tdp-server` can be used without `tdp-ui`, etc.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to install TDP Manager are as follows:

- Have configured the [control node](/en/learn/installation/control-node)
- Have configured the [managed nodes](/en/learn/installation/managed-nodes)

## Admin CLI Installation

### Installation

#### Virtual environment

The creation of a virtual environment is recommended. For example using [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
# Creation and activation of a virtual environment (optional)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Dependencies

The installation of `tdp-lib` can be done via `pip`:

```bash
# Installation of dependencies
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
# Installation of tdp-lib and the CLI
pip install "tdp-lib[visualization]@https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-lib/tarball/master"
```

### Configuration

#### Ansible configuration

`tdp-lib` uses the `ansible-playbook` command to execute playbooks. It must be callable without options and without user interaction (Ansible Vault, privilege escalation, etc.).

Settings given in the control node page ensure that Ansible is correctly configured.

#### CLI configuration

Most options passed to the CLI can be configured via environment variables. It is recommended to define in a `.env` file at the root of the project the variables commonly used:

- `TDP_COLLECTION_PATH`, list of paths to collections, separated by the path separator of the operating system (verifiable with the command `python -c "import os; print(os.pathsep)"`).
- `TDP_RUN_DIRECTORY`, the directory in which the Ansible commands will be executed (must contain the `ansible.cfg` file).
- `TDP_VARS`, the directory containing the cluster variables. It can be empty if the initialization is done via the CLI.
- `TDP_DATABASE_DSN`, address of the database to use. (For example for a SQLite database: `sqlite:///tdp.db`)

### Initialization

The CLI relies on:

- A relational database that stores metadata related to deployments.
- A folder that centralizes the configurations of the different services (`tdp_vars`).

These two elements are initialized via the command:

```bash
# Initialization of the database and the tdp_vars folder
tdp init
```

The `tdp_vars` folder is populated by concatenating the `tdp_vars_default` folders defined in each collection as well as all the folders provided via the `--overrides` option.

### Usage

See the CLI documentation: [CLI](/en/learn/usage/cli).

## Server Installation

The server is a work in progress.

## UI Installation

The ui is a work in progress.
