# Managed nodes setup

Prerequisites are required to deploy TDP on the cluster nodes (excluding the control node).

Hardware, network, operating system, software and security prerequisites are defined in the [Deployment Requirements](/en/learn/misc/requirements).

## `tdp-collection-prerequisites`

A `tdp-collection-prerequisites` collection, tested with Rocky 8 and AlmaLinux 8, facilitates the installation of the prerequisites needed for TDP on the hosts.

For a production cluster, it is recommended not to use this collection and to have a highly available PostgreSQL, LDAP and Kerberos cluster.

### Usage

The `tdp-collection-prerequisites` collection is installed as the other collections on the control node:

1. Install the collection using [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/).

   Complete the `requirements.yml` file:

   ```yml
   collections:
     # [...] Main collections defined in the control node setup

     # Prerequesites
     # Contains roles to install prerequisites on machines.
     - name: https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-collection-prerequisites
       type: git
       version: master
     - name: community.postgresql
       version: 2.4.2
     - name: community.crypto
       version: 2.14.0
   ```

   Use the `ansible-galaxy command`:

   ```sh
   ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
   ```

2. Create the desired topology file in the inventory (e.g. `/path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies/prerequesites`). An exemple file is provided in the collection:

   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_prerequisites/topology.ini /path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies/prerequisites
   ```

3. Install the prerequisites on the hosts defined in the inventory:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_prerequisites/playbooks/all.yml
   ```

Note: A warning about `tdp_vars` may appear. The `tdp-collection-prerequisites` collection does not use `tdp_vars`, so this warning can be ignored.

## Next steps

You can now deploy TDP either [purely using Ansible](/en/learn/usage/manual), or by [installing TDP Manager](/en/learn/installation/tdp-manager) to facilitate deployment via CLI, server, or UI.
