# Managed nodes setup

Prerequisites are required to deploy TDP on the cluster nodes (excluding the control node).

Hardware, network, operating system, software and security prerequisites are defined in the [Deployment Requirements](/en/learn/misc/requirements).

## `tdp-collection-prerequisites`

A `tdp-collection-prerequisites` collection, tested with Rocky 8 and AlmaLinux 8, facilitates the installation of the prerequisites needed for TDP on the hosts.

For a production cluster, it is recommended not to use this collection and to have a highly available PostgreSQL, LDAP and Kerberos cluster.

The following command installs the prerequisites on all hosts defined in the inventory:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible_dependencies/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_prerequisites/playbooks/all.yml
```

Note: A warning about `tdp_vars` may appear. The `tdp-collection-prerequisites` collection does not use `tdp_vars`, so this warning can be ignored.

## Next steps

It is now possible to deploy TDP on the hosts, in 2 different ways:

- [Manual deployment](/en/learn/usage/manual)
- [TDP Manager deployment](/en/learn/usage/cli)
