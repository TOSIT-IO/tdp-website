# Control node setup

This page allows you to configure the control node used to deploy TDP. It can be used for both manual deployment or with [TDP Manager](/en/learn/installation/tdp-manager).

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to configure the control node is to have access to [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). The following operating systems have been tested:

- CentOS 7
- Rocky 8
- AlmaLinux 8

The installation can be done on other operating systems, but some features may not be available.

Note: In the context of TDP Manager installation, it is recommended to use the version of Ansible contained in the [TDP Manager virtual environment](/en/learn/installation/tdp-manager#installation).

## Ansible configuration

The Ansible configuration file, `ansible.cfg`, requires some specificities specific to TDP:

```ini
[defaults]
inventory=/path/to/tdp/inventory ; REQUIRED path to the directory containing the Ansible inventory.
collections_paths=/path/to/tdp/collections/ ; RECOMMENDED paths to the directories containing the Ansible collections.
display_skipped_hosts=False ; RECOMMENDED to avoid displaying skipped Ansible tasks and cluttering the logs.
any_errors_fatal=True ; REQUIRED to stop Ansible execution as soon as an error occurs and prevent Ansible from continuing on the remaining hosts.

; RECOMMENDED to significantly speed up playbook launches, as installing TDP involves many calls to the `ansible-playbook` command.
[inventory]
cache = true
cache_plugin = jsonfile
cache_timeout = 7200
cache_connection = .cache


; REQUIRED to activate the `tdp_vars` plugin, which builds the variables used by TDP's Ansible collections.
[tdp]
vars = tdp_vars

; REQUIRED to activate the switch to the `root` user for all Ansible tasks.
[privilege_escalation]
become=True
become_user=root
```

Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#the-configuration-file) for more information on configuration options and the location of the `ansible.cfg` file.

## Installation of collections

TDP components are distributed across different Ansible collections.

The collections to be installed must be declared in a `requirements.yml` file:

```yml
---
collections:
  # Required
  # Contains the main services (HDFS, YARN, Hive, etc.) as well as the plugins needed to manage variables.
  - name: community.general
    version: 7.1.0
  - name: https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-collection
    type: git
    version: master
  # Optional
  # Contains additional components (Kafka, Hue, Airflow, etc.).
  - name: https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-collection-extras
    type: git
    version: master
  # Optional
  # Contains components dedicated to observability (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
  - name: community.grafana
    version: 1.5.4
  - name: https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-observability
    type: git
    version: main
  # Optional
  # Contains roles to install prerequisites on machines (CentOS 7 or Rocky 8).
  - name: community.postgresql
    version: 2.4.2
  - name: community.crypto
    version: 2.14.0
  - name: https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-collection-prerequisites
    type: git
    version: master
```

The collections are installed via `ansible-galaxy`. The collections are installed in the first directory specified by the `collections_paths` property of the `ansible.cfg` file:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

### Additional dependencies for TDP Observability

If TDP Observability has been installed, additional dependencies must be installed:

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_observability/requirements.txt
```

## Definition of the Ansible inventory

The Ansible inventory defines the hosts on which to deploy TDP, the distribution of components on these hosts, and the use of any plugins. For TDP, the inventory is organized as follows:

```txt
/path/to/tdp/inventory/
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml
├── hosts
├── topologies/
│   ├── 01_tdp
│   ├── tdp_extra
│   ├── tdp_observability
│   └── tdp_prerequisites
└── tdp_vars.yml
```

### Installation of the `tdp_vars` plugin

The `tdp_vars` plugin builds the variables used by TDP's Ansible collections. It is installed by creating the file `/path/to/tdp/inventory/tdp_vars.yml` with the following content:

```yml
plugin: tosit.tdp.tdp_vars
```

### Global variables

Some variables **must** be common to all hosts. They are specified in the file `group_vars/all.yml`.

Create the file `/path/to/tdp/inventory/group_vars/all.yml` by completing the following values:

```yml
---
domain: # DNS domain of the cluster
realm: # Kerberos realm name
kerberos_admin_principal: # Kerberos administrator ID
kerberos_admin_password: # Kerberos administrator password
kadmin_principal: # Kerberos administrator ID
kadmin_password: # Kerberos administrator password
```

**For example**:

```yml
---
domain: tdp
realm: TDP.LOCAL
kerberos_admin_principal: 'admin/admin@{{ realm }}'
kerberos_admin_password: admin123
kadmin_principal: '{{ kerberos_admin_principal }}'
kadmin_password: '{{ kerberos_admin_password }}'
```

### Hosts

The `hosts` file defines the hosts on which to deploy TDP. It is an [Ansible inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html) file.

The inventory file must define the following groups:

- `edge`
- `master`
- `master1`
- `master2`
- `master3`
- `worker`

Create a file `/path/to/tdp/inventory/hosts` adapted to your infrastructure by completing the following content:

```ini
[edge]
; List of hosts in the edge group

[master1]
; List of hosts in the master1 group

[master2]
; List of hosts in the master2 group

[master3]
; List of hosts in the master3 group

[master:children]
master1
master2
master3

[worker]
; List of hosts in the worker group
```

**For example**, for a cluster of 6 machines (1 edge, 3 masters, and 2 workers), the `hosts` file will be as follows:

```ini
[edge]
edge-01 ansible_host=edge01.tdp.local

[master1]
master-01 ansible_host=master01.tdp.local

[master2]
master-02 ansible_host=master02.tdp.local

[master3]
master-03 ansible_host=master03.tdp.local

[master:children]
master1
master2
master3

[worker]
worker-01 ansible_host=worker01.tdp.local
worker-02 ansible_host=worker02.tdp.local
```

### Topologies

The topology files define the organization of the components (HDFS NameNode, Hive Metastore, etc.) on the different hosts. They are also Ansible inventory files.

Each collection comes with an example topology file (`topology.ini` file).

`tdp-collection` is the main collection. Its topology file must be read first. To do this, it is recommended to prefix its name with `01-`.

Copy the topology file from `tdp-collection` to the `/path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies` directory:

```bash
cp /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp/topology.ini /path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies/01-tdp
```

If other collections are installed, their topologies must also be added so that they are taken into account. The topologies of the other collections can rely on the group names defined in the `tdp-collection` topology.

```bash
cp /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_extra/topology.ini /path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies/tdp_extra
cp /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_observability/topology.ini /path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies/tdp_observability
cp /path/to/tdp/collections/ansible_collections/tosit/tdp_prerequisites/topology.ini /path/to/tdp/inventory/topologies/tdp_prerequisites
```

These files are to be edited according to the desired component distribution.

**For example**, the following topology allows you to deploy a Hive Metastore on the hosts of the `master2` and `master3` groups:

```ini
[hive_ms:children]
master2
master3
```

### Next steps

The control node is now configured to deploy TDP.

It is now necessary to prepare the managed nodes to host the deployment. The list of prerequisites is available on the [managed nodes](/en/learn/installation/managed-nodes) page.
