## Pull Requests

Weekly review of open PRs (in chronological order):

- [tdp-website#86](https://github.com/TOSIT-IO/tdp-website/pull/86): status of "feat(reports): 240517 contributors report". PR merged.

## Open topics

Release of TDP stack 3.1 is targeted in 2 weeks with TDP-lib 1.1-beta.

TDP-lib still needs to have Alembic integrated before release. The version `beta` has been decided since some refactoring will still take place before the stable release.

TDP-website still needs to include a `Release` page with all service versions associated to the corresponding TDP stack and TDP-lib version before release.
