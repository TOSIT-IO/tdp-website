# Notes from September 26th, 2025

Iceberg tables created with Hive and Spark do not have the same default properties. For example, with the following properties:
table-override.external.table.purge and table-override.iceberg.orc.files.only.

## Open Topics

### tdp-lib

- During a cluster failure, the command to stop the process was launched, but it raised an error because it required the Postgres database: tdp-lib was connected to Postgres, and it was down. It has been discussed to create meta-scripts to start, stop, and restart.

- A problem between Spark and YARN has been detected: YARN wants to create a symbolic link to the Spark3 JAR, but it cannot because Spark3 is deployed after YARN. This seems to come from the way dynamic allocation has been scheduled. The DAG needs to be modified.
