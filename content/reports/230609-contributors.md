# Notes from June 9th, 2023

- Docker Out Of Docker (DooD) and Gradle for tdp-builder: PR to be splited in 2 (Romain)
- Close PR 0.8.0 and release 0.7.2 (Pierre)
- HBase 2.x for timeline server: to be transfered into a new repo (Romain will contact Damien)
- Alternatives python to python3: not validated due to potential OS impacts, avoiding the usage of /usr/bin/python is the recommanded approach, to be further discussed
- TDP website presentation and PR merge (David)
- Discussions around adopting a workflow such as Git Flow: not yet, open to re-open the request depending on usage and future frustrations, unit testing enforcement is more of a priority to preserve stability
