# Notes from September 26th, 2025

Iceberg tables created with Hive and Spark do not have the same default properties. For example, with the following properties:
table-override.external.table.purge and table-override.iceberg.orc.files.only.

## Open Topics

### Iceberg

Error when deleting tables from spark session catalog that changes user behaviour. The proposal is not to use iceberg by default in spark but to force the use of iceberg with spark. This would allow the SparkSessionCatalog class issue to be bypassed by using the sparkCatalog class with iceberg instead.
